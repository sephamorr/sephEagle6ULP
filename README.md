=============

a selection of user language programs (ULP's) for Eagle 6

Files:
brd_to_dsn_v7.ulp: converter for use with freerouting.net autorouter. Other versions fail in instantly closing the file selector dialog. This saves the dsn to the board directory

rippoly.ulp: rip up polygons without needing to reopen the file

svg*.ulp: importers for svg files into eagle polygon format. questionable functionality, read the headers.

zoom-unrouted.ulp: ever spend forever searching for the .1mm long airwire that eludes you? this zooms in on it.

zoompart.ulp: zooms in on the requested part, ie no searching
